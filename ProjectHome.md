# Summary #
The main purpose of this library is to be a testbed for rendering HL2 bsp map. Plan to support shading tech like radiosity normal map, ambient cube, and HDR.

# Feature #
  * Support only Direct3D and Shader Model **3.0** (I am too lazy to write fallback code).
  * Support Half-Life 2 map and model loading.
  * **No** fixed pipeline. Shader materials are necessary.
  * Very unstable and buggy.

# Note #
It is heavily copied from other open source projects(irrlicht, ogre), books, and web resources.
